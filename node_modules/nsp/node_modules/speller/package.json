You can read more about the approach in the original article:\n\n[http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html](http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html)\n\nThe code is [CommonJS](http://commonjs.org/)-compliant, so it can be\nused both inside and outside of a web browser. For the latter case there are a\ncouple of command-line scripts demonstrating its use that depend on\n[narwhal](http://narwhaljs.org/) or [node](http://nodejs.org/). You may use the\ntusk and [npm](http://npmjs.org) package managers to install speller on narwhal\nand node, respectively. Alternatively, you can see the code in action right\ninside your browser in the following page:\n\n[http://past.github.com/speller/](http://past.github.com/speller/)\n\nContents\n--------\n\n* lib/speller.js is the spell-checker implementation \n* demo/speller.html is an HTML file that shows how to use speller.js (you can try it [here](http://past.github.com/speller/))\n* bin/spellcheck is a Unix/Linux shell script, that depends on [narwhal](http://narwhaljs.org/) and shows how to use speller.js outside the browser\n* bin/speller is a Unix/Linux shell script, that depends on [node](http://nodejs.org/) and shows how to use speller.js outside the browser\n* bin/big.txt is Peter Norvig's original training file, with about a million words\n* tests/spelltest.js is a [CommonJS](http://commonjs.org/)-compliant test suite, that uses Norvig's original test cases\n* tests/test is a Unix/Linux shell script, that depends on [narwhal](http://narwhaljs.org/) and runs the tests in spelltest.js\n* tests/test-node is a Unix/Linux shell script, that depends on [node](http://nodejs.org/) and runs the tests in spelltest.js\n* demo/worker.js is a [Web Worker](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-workers/current-work/) that allows the tests in spelltest.js to run inside a browser\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nCopyright (c) 2009 Panagiotis Astithas\n\nPermission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software for any\npurpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above\ncopyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES\nWITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS.
